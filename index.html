    <h1>Hi, I'm Bonnie Remeika. I am a Product Designer, Full-Stack Developer & Digital Strategist. I'm in the Akron Cleveland OH area and am open to work!</h1>
  <br>
<h2>This portfolio site is currently under active development. For the most current and comprehensive overview of my work, please visit <a href="http://www.otherly.site" target="_blank">Otherly.site</a>. I am responsible for the complete design, character development, concept creation, and site maintenance/coding for Otherly.</h2>
<br>    
<p>Otherly also serves as my living laboratory for e-commerce. I personally built its entire sales funnel, integrating platforms such as Shopify, TikTok, and Pinterest Internationally. This hands-on approach aligns with my belief that practical experience is the most effective way to master a domain, providing me with firsthand expertise across these crucial digital channels.</p>
    <p>In a separate, focused endeavor to understand social media dynamics, I created these short video reels. Through active experimentation with platform algorithms, I gained valuable insights and achieved a notable success: the Bubble Tea Kitty video went mini-viral with nearly 17,000 views, a clear demonstration of practical algorithmic understanding. 
    Please explore these examples of my work.</p>

    <br>

    <p>I’ve built UI/UX systems, branding identities, psychographic commerce flows, and experimental digital products across industries from biotech to fashion. I blend speculative thinking, behavioral insight, and creative intuition to build things that feel alive, functional, and emotionally resonant.</p>
    <p>I specialize in systems and stories: from terpene-tagged apparel lines to fake tech retail worlds, AI-driven video content, and emotionally intelligent character platforms. My work blends design strategy, cultural pattern recognition, and worldbuilding across mediums.</p>
    <p>I’m also a front-end developer and graphic designer with deep experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the full Adobe Creative Suite. Whether I’m building an interface, a product, or a brand world — I think in structure, motion, and emotional utility.</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 2rem; line-height: 1.2;">Bunny Anarchy</h2>
  <p>Bunny Anarchy is a character-driven design system disguised as a streetwear brand. Built around symbolic rebellion and alt-girl aesthetics, it explores how fashion can become narrative armor. As a design project, it bridges apparel, semiotics, and emotional UX — developing an anti-cute visual language that merges martial iconography, folklore, and subcultural cues. Bunny Anarchy isn’t just style — it’s a provocation. A test of what people are willing to wear when the design is saying something back.</p>

    <div class="card" style="--bg:url('/assets/images/rabio-shack-bg.jpg');">






  <h2 style="font-size: 2rem; line-height: 1.2;">Rabio Shack</h2>
  <p>This project came from finally giving myself permission to create without a commercial filter. Rabio Shack is a fake tech brand — part haunted strip mall tribute, part visual playground. I used it as a space to experiment with shirts, mock ads, ASCII branding, and narrative UI. I love retro tech design, and this gave me the perfect excuse to make 80s-style ads that feel like transmissions from another timeline.</p>

</div>
    <div class="card rabio">
  <h2>Rabio Branding</h2>
  <p>This is the visual spine of Rabio Shack — fake logos, busted UI banners, fake forms, dead technology, and ASCII interface design. This was an exploration in anti-branding and nostalgic decay, creating something that looks halfway between a 90s tech catalog and an alternate-universe operating system. It was also a personal study in intentional degradation of visual logic, layout warping, and logic-skipping design that still hangs together enough to feel real.</p>
</div>
    <div class="card wyolt">
  <h2>WYOLT</h2>
  <p>Before WYOLT, there was the Silent Witness — the still point, the singularity. Ignited by a Dark Spark, that quiet force erupted like a personal big bang. WYOLT is what came after. It’s my space to experiment with anything I need to make: music, video, physical wall pieces, jewelry, sculpture, photography. It’s a space for eruption, process, and pleasure — not branding. Just signal, transmission, and whatever happens next.</p>
</div>
    <div class="card nrdgrl">
  <h2>NRDGRL</h2>
  <p>NRDGRL is a concept site built in the spirit of '90s cyberpunk tech-girl energy — think Acid Burn from <em>Hackers</em> and Cameron from <em>Halt and Catch Fire</em>, run by Pris from <em>Blade Runner</em>. It's part fashion lab, part video design space, and part narrative art container for weird, obsessive tech-girl expression. The brand is unapologetically specific: part homage, part future broadcast. It's also a forthcoming YouTube series that documents what I'm nerding out on — tools, techniques, and strange creative workflows.</p>

    <div class="card shorts">
  <h2>YouTube Shorts</h2>
  <p>I used these shorts to learn how different platforms index and amplify video — especially how sounds, captions, and timing affect visibility. It was part creative exploration, part visibility experiment. I ran content across TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and Instagram Reels to study algorithmic behavior and audience sync. One experiment hit nearly 16K views, which helped me understand the landscape and sharpen my instinct for video timing and structure.</p>
